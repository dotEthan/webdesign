# Portfolio Site
[Paper Street Web Designs](http://ethanstrauss.com/paperstreetwebdesigns)

I wanted to fill out my portfolio with different themes, I also wanted to work with the CSS3 Animations and Transforms.

### Status

Finished. Code just needs to be run through babel, minimize, etc.

## Overview and Thoughts

### What Worked

The site looks and acts as I hoped on modern browsers.

### What Didn't Work

As one would expect the moving icons have issues with older browsers as some of the important CSS is not supported. 

## What Lessons Were Learned

Designing first works wonders, but always check browser compatibility.
